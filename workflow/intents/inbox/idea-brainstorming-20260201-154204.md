# idea brainstorming

## Description

Come up with a project to build out of this list


Text interception for messaging apps, immessage, discord, slack etc... that appliex the hemingway method and additional context asa validation.

Essentially the problem is I tend to send people walls of text, it'd be nice if when I go to send a message, I have an llm intercept the message before the message sends so I can apply criteria for a validation check, like is this too long, can wee be more concise, will this person read in this context, etc...

## Context

<!-- Why is this needed? What triggered this idea? -->

## Notes

<!-- Additional thoughts, references, or considerations -->
