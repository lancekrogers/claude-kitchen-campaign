# Active

Work actively being done.

## Purpose

Items in this directory are currently in progress. This is where you spend most of your time.

## Workflow

Move items here when you start working on them:
```bash
camp flow move some-item active
```

When finished or blocked, move to ready or dungeon:
```bash
camp flow move some-item ready           # Needs next step
camp flow move some-item dungeon/completed  # Done
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep this lean - only what you're actively touching
2. If something sits here untouched for days, consider moving to ready
3. Use for work-in-progress, not "might get to someday"
