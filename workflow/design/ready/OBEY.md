# Ready

Prepared and ready for action.

## Purpose

Items here are ready to be worked on but not currently in progress. Dependencies are met, specs are clear, just waiting for attention.

## Workflow

Items arrive here from outside or return from active:
```bash
camp flow move some-item ready
```

When you start working, move to active:
```bash
camp flow move some-item active
```

If deprioritized or blocked:
```bash
camp flow move some-item dungeon/someday  # Maybe later
```

## Best Practices

1. This is your backlog - review periodically
2. Items should be actionable - if blocked, note why
3. Keep descriptions clear so you remember context
